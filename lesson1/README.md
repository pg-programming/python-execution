# Lesson 1 Homework

The homework consists of two programs.

- Tip Calculator
- GPA Calculator (optional)

Some small suggestions or hints are given in both of the program files. I have
provided a sample program (`basics.py`) to provide you with a template for
solving your problems. Feel free to copy portions of my code to use in your
programs but I highly recommend that you fully understand what it is doing
first.
